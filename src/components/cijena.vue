                    <p>A detailed floor plan drawn in ArchiCAD ensures that each room of your home is planned and spaced correctly. Floor plans are one-dimensional drawings that show what the room will look like from above, and they help both designer and client agree on exactly what the layout of each room will be. Furthermore, they provide necessary measurements for contractors to fully understand the scope of work.</p>
                    <p class="py-8 font-bold text-[15px]">THIS STEP INCLUDES:</p>
                    <p>- First meeting: we talk about working conditions and options, your preferences in design considering the initial data and capabilities of the object, budget and your expectations of overall process.</p>
                    <p>- Signinig the contract.</p>
                    <p>- Making measurements of the object: specialists carry out photofixation and 3D scanning of the space.</p>
                    <p>- Questionnaire: we ask you to fill in the table with questions in order to get the detailed information of your requirements.</p>
                    <p>- We make a moodboard and TOR (Terms of reference) to make sure that we'll pursue the write goal.</p>
                    <p>- Planning solutions: we work on options for floorplans in accordance with the TOR and the parameters of the object and discuss them together. <b>This step results in the purfect floorplan  of your apartment.</b></p>

                    <p>Once a floor plan is complete, we are able to create a three-dimensional photo-realistic rendering of your space, down to the very last detail. This will give you the fullest picture of your home; our renderings are often indistinguishable from photographs. This step is important because it allows our clients to see exactly what the finished product will look like before production starts.</p>
                    <p class="py-8 font-bold text-[15px]">THIS STEP INCLUDES:</p>
                    <p>- Creating black and white 3D space considering all complex joints and connections of parts in your interior making it architecturally logical and clean.</p>
                    <p>- We discuss this black and white design with you in order to make you feel the space, furniture sizes and get the feedback from you about furniture forms and different elements of the composition. We need to know for sure that you like the shape of the sofa.</p>
                    <p>- We work on textures/ colors and materials after we approve the white model.</p>
                    <p>- We discuss with you the final version of renders. Edit if necessary.</p>

                    <p>Technical documentation is literally an instruction to make our vizualisations real. It's a very important part of any design project to make it proper and complete. The drawings have all the necessary dimensions, references and a lot of comments for the contractors. We work in great detail on the joints, nodes and complex connections of materials that are proposed in the project.</p>
